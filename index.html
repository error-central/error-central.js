	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>
		Its an open secret these days that software development consists of a lot of
		"run code", "get error", "copy-paste-error to google", "open top Stack Overflow link".
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Good</em> developers know meta-search skills like removing code-specific
		function and variable names or recognizing when the results are too general.
		They know when to add a dependency to the search, or perhaps a bit of the stack trace.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Experienced</em> developers know when they are out of options, and will
		"escalate" to asking co-workers/co-contributers on Slack. "Has anyone seen
		this error before?"
	</p>

	<h2>What is this?</h2>

	<p>
		This repot is a "concept car" of what error messages could be. We hope it will spur
		interest and perhaps this can become a real tool someday. This works for
		javascript errors in Chrome or Firefox, but these ideas could be extended to
		anywhere errors appear
	</p>

	<p>
		We have also built basic versions of this functionality as a
		<a href="https://github.com/error-central/error-central/tree/master/vscode-extension">
			plugin for VS Code</a>, and directly in the terminal (bash).
	</p>

	<h2>Fundamentals</h2>
	<pre>
		- Deeper description of error from official docs
			- Ideal world there'd be some standard so that any package (e.g. react)
			  could publish error info. But for now we do it by hand.
		- Where possible, error description in developers native language (esp
		  important for beginnerin developers)
			- '<em>"0"-prefixed octal literals and octal escape seq. are deprecated</em>' is a
			  tough English sentance for a non-native speaker.
	</pre>

	<h2>Automate actions good devs do already</h2>
	<pre>
		- Search google. 80% of the time land on stackoverflow
			- Including long-shot searches that a coder would only do
			- Remove code-specific parts of error that would be irrelevant,
			  e.g. "myFunnyVariableName"
		- Search open issues for the project
			- If some other dev has reported the problem, know it immediately.
		- Search dependencies
			- Use stack trace to infer what dependency might be culpre
			- Serach open issues for dependencies
			- Extend serach to issues for dependencies, even going down entire
			  dependency textarea
		- Search with stack trace
		- OVERALL: know what a "good" result looks like.
			- A match with stack trace is better than one just for general type of error
	</pre>

	<h2>Analytics and sociality</h2>
	<pre>
		- Record errors and context.
		- Has this error been spiking worldwide in the last 24 hours? (Maybe a
		  dependency had a botched upgrade.)
		- Basic analytics on error freqency and first occurance. (a la Sentry)
		- Who of my co-workers/co-contributors has seen this error?
			- Especially if with same/similar stack trace / branch
	</pre>

	<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
	<pre>
		- We can also go <em>beyond</em> automating developer behavior.
		- Instead of naive text matching search, use the full context of an error
			when searching for relevant answers, issues, people.
			- Repo / branch
			- Stack trace
			- Dependencies
			- Input/launch configurations
		- Use the logging info to record the total context of an error. Then when
			the error happens later for someone else, they can know who to talk to, or
			even automatically see what worked to fix it.
	</pre>
