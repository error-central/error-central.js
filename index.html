		<h1>Re-thinking Error messages and automating good engineers
			<!-- : Demo of Error Central for javascript -->
		</h1>




		<p>The Github repo for this demo is <a href="https://github.com/error-central/error-central.js">here</a>.</p>


		<p>
			This is an interactive demo imaging a better experience for error messages.
			I hope it will spark discussion, spur some interest, and perhaps lead to some great new tools.
		</p>

		<p>
			To view the demo <strong>open the javascript console in your browser</strong> by pressing
			<code>Option-Command-J</code>. Please experience it in Chrome or Firefox.
		</p>


		<h3>Errors should link to docs</h3>
		<p>
			A small improvement would be to simply connect errors to the web. For now, let's just give the user a link to the
			official docs for the error. Better yet, link to the docs in the user's language.
		</p>
		<form>
			<textarea name="code">
undefinedFunction(4)
			</textarea>
			<input type="button" onclick="formEvalForError(this.form);" value="Execute" />
		</form>


		<h3>Automatically search Stack Overflow</h3>
		<p>It's an open secret that the first thing you do when you get an error is to search for it. So why are developers
			manually selecting text and copy-pasting it into Google? We know that 90% of the time we're going to end up on
			Stack
			Overflow, so let's automatically search there.
		</p>
		<form>
			<textarea name="code">
if (3 > Math.PI {
	console.log("wait what?");
}
		</textarea>
			<input type="button" onclick="doSo=true; formEvalForError(this.form);" value="Execute" />
		</form>

		<h3>...But be smart when searching</h3>
		<p>
			Any developer knows when to strip out details that are specific to their code. Our system should be smart enough
			to
			do
			this too. Of course, there are times when these little details are important, for example when the error happens
			in
			a
			specific line of a dependency. So the right thing to do is to search for both the exact text and for a "generic"
			version.
		</p>

		<form>
			<textarea name="code">
undefinedFunction(4)
			</textarea>
			<input type="button" onclick="doSo=true; doSoGeneric=true; formEvalForError(this.form);" value="Execute" />
		</form>



		<h3>Recognize what a “good” result is</h3>

		<p>Our smarter error handler should also have the smarts to know what a good result is. A "good" result is one that
			is
			recent, that contains a substantial match to the query.
		</p>

		<p><em>Not yet implemented :(</em></p>



		<h3>Search known issues</h3>
		<p>
			Sometimes the error you're having is a known issue with your repo. Shouldn't you be notified of that right away?
			So let's also search the repo issues and wiki!
		</p>

		<form>
			<textarea name="code">
undefinedFunction(4)
					</textarea>
			<input type="button" onclick="doSo=true; doSoGeneric=true; doGithub=true; formEvalForError(this.form);"
				value="Execute" />
		</form>

		<p>
			And while we're at it: If there is no open issue for our error, let's provide a quick link to create one!
		</p>

		<form>
			<textarea name="code">
aDifferentUndefinedFunction(4)
						</textarea>
			<input type="button" onclick="doSo=true; doSoGeneric=true; doGithub=true; formEvalForError(this.form);"
				value="Execute" />
		</form>

		<h3>Search with dependencies</h3>
		<p>
			Any good developer knows that sometimes you need to "massage" your error search query with details about your
			environment. The first plan of attack here is to try adding dependency names to your search queries. So if your
			project
			uses react, you might add "react" to the query. Rather than try to guess which dependency to add, why not just try
			all
			of them?
		</p>

		<p>
			Doing this in the demo would exhaust our quota for Stack Overflow, so we'll just link to the searches. (But in a
			perfect solution, all of these searches would happen in the background and you'd be alerted to any good looking
			results.)
		</p>

		<p>
			Run this code, and then select the "React" search from the dependencies.
		</p>
		<form>
			<textarea name="code">
Array.apply(null, new Array(1000000)).map(Math.random);
								</textarea>
			<input type="button"
				onclick="doSo=true; doSoGeneric=true; doGithub=true; doDependencies=true; formEvalForError(this.form);"
				value="Execute" />
		</form>


		<p>
			All this searching is great, but sometimes the problem isn't in our repo at all, but in one of our dependencies.
		</p>
		<p>
			So let's search issues for our dependencies.
		</p>





		<p>...more to come...</p>



		<h3>Notes</h3>
		<p>
			While this shows off error messagse in a browser, the same concepts apply in any programming envitonment. My
			friend Gabe and I also built similar functionality as a
			<a href="https://github.com/error-central/error-central/tree/master/vscode-extension">
				plugin for VS Code</a>, and directly in the terminal (bash).

		<h1>Old outline:</h1>
		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>
			Its an open secret these days that software development consists of a lot of
			"run code", "get error", "copy-paste-error to google", "open top Stack Overflow link".
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Good</em> developers know meta-search skills like removing code-specific
			function and variable names or recognizing when the results are too general.
			They know when to add a dependency to the search, or perhaps a bit of the stack trace.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Experienced</em> developers know when they are out of options, and will
			"escalate" to asking co-workers/co-contributers on Slack. "Has anyone seen
			this error before?"
		</p>

		<h3>What is this?</h3>

		<p>
			This repot is a "concept car" of what error messages could be. We hope it will spur
			interest and perhaps this can become a real tool someday. This works for
			javascript errors in Chrome or Firefox, but these ideas could be extended to
			anywhere errors appear
		</p>

		<p>
			We have also built basic versions of this functionality as a
			<a href="https://github.com/error-central/error-central/tree/master/vscode-extension">
				plugin for VS Code</a>, and directly in the terminal (bash).
		</p>

		<h3>Fundamentals</h3>
		<pre>
		- Deeper description of error from official docs
			- Ideal world there'd be some standard so that any package (e.g. react)
			  could publish error info. But for now we do it by hand.
		- Where possible, error description in developers native language (esp
		  important for beginnerin developers)
			- '<em>"0"-prefixed octal literals and octal escape seq. are deprecated</em>' is a
			  tough English sentance for a non-native speaker.
	</pre>

		<h3>Automate actions good devs do already</h3>
		<pre>
		- Search google. 80% of the time land on stackoverflow
			- Including long-shot searches that a coder would only do
			- Remove code-specific parts of error that would be irrelevant,
			  e.g. "myFunnyVariableName"
		- Search open issues for the project
			- If some other dev has reported the problem, know it immediately.
		- Search dependencies
			- Use stack trace to infer what dependency might be culpre
			- Serach open issues for dependencies
			- Extend serach to issues for dependencies, even going down entire
			  dependency textarea
		- Search with stack trace
		- OVERALL: know what a "good" result looks like.
			- A match with stack trace is better than one just for general type of error
	</pre>

		<h3>Analytics and sociality</h3>
		<pre>
		- Record errors and context.
		- Has this error been spiking worldwide in the last 24 hours? (Maybe a
		  dependency had a botched upgrade.)
		- Basic analytics on error freqency and first occurance. (a la Sentry)
		- Who of my co-workers/co-contributors has seen this error?
			- Especially if with same/similar stack trace / branch
	</pre>

		<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
		<pre>
		- We can also go <em>beyond</em> automating developer behavior.
		- Instead of naive text matching search, use the full context of an error
			when searching for relevant answers, issues, people.
			- Repo / branch
			- Stack trace
			- Dependencies
			- Input/launch configurations
		- Use the logging info to record the total context of an error. Then when
			the error happens later for someone else, they can know who to talk to, or
			even automatically see what worked to fix it.
	</pre>
